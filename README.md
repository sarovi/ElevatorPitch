ElevatorPitch

### Elevator Pitch Assigment
Hellow, if you have children, you will notice that they carry a lot of weight every day in their bags or also they forgot their books or homeworks al home. 

We propose a multiplataform for studients, teachers and parents. This plataform included all the books of all the subjects, also a lot of notes of teachers, and all exercices (and optional exercices for study more). Anothes point is that fathers have control of calendar and marks of their childrens, because now a days if children doesn't say anithing you don't learn. 

This plataform will be cheaper than books because familiesonly pay the license, but if they want have an additional prices for more service for example to purchase more exercices for prepareted an exam.
